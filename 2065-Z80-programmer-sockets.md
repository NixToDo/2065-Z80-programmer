## IC Sockets

You can buy fancy expensive ones, or you can buy cheap ones.
I used the cheap ones.  

Alternately, you can just solder the chips into the PCB.

As a tinkerer, the thing that is wrong with that is that it makes it very hard to 
recycle/repurpose the chips for something else in the future.  And with the 2021
chip-shortage in full-force on as I type this, being able to recycle chips is 
VERY appealing!

Be honest with yourself before sinking more money into sockets than the cost of the chips 
that go into them.  I expect the cheap ones to last for at least a decade or two.  Cheap
sockets in my hobby projects from 30 years ago are still doing fine.

Gold plating is better than tin.  Machined pins are better than
stamped spring-metal pins. 

I used four 14-pin sockets because I hand them in stock.  
But you can alternately order two 28-pin sockets if you prefer.

## Shorting Blocks

This is used to (dis)connect the 5V power supply from the PI.
